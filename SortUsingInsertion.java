/*Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm, it builds the final sorted array one item 
at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than other sort algorithms.

Advantages of Insertion Sort: 

1) It is very simple.
2) It is very efficient for small data sets.
3) It is stable; i.e., it does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys.
4) In-place; i.e., only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space.

Insertion sort iterates through the list by consuming one input element at 
each repetition, and growing a sorted output list. On a repetition, insertion sort
removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the
sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.*/
